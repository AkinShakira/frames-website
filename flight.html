      Trip From The States To Lagos

      The day of departure had finally arrived. The nine of us travelled from across the US to our rally point in Frankfurt, Germany. It was strange to see snow on the way to Africa. In fact, there was so much snow that it delayed us for three hours. And then we had another three-hour delay at the end of the trip when we were diverted briefly to Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, for no apparent reason.

      Despite the 6-hour flight that turned into 12 hours, there was a silver lining. A couple hours after takeoff, the woman I was sitting next to asked me about the code I was writing on my laptop. We got to talking and it turns out she is co-founder of a coding school in Lagos! We had no trouble filling the time for the rest of the trip, and I was able to get a nice preview of the Lagos tech scene from her.
