      Lagos Island is connected to the mainland by three large bridges (the Carter Bridge, the Eko Bridge and the Third Mainland Bridge) which cross Lagos Lagoon to the district of Ebute Metta. It is also linked to the neighbouring island of Ikoyi and to Victoria Island. The Lagos harbour district of Apapa faces the western side of the island. Forming the main commercial district of Lagos, Lagos Island plays host to the main government buildings, shops and offices. The Catholic and Anglican Cathedrals, as well as the Central Mosque, are located here.

It has notable landmarks such as Marina road and Freedom Park. Some important places are Cathedral Church (CMS), Eko Electricity Distribution Company (Marina) and Nigerian Ports Authority (Marina).
