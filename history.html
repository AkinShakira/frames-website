      The History Behind Lagos State.
    </h1>
    <p class="body">
      Lagos which means “lakes”, was a name given to the settlement by the Portuguese.The state initially emerged as a port city which originated on a collection of islands. The islands are separated by creeks, fringing the southwest mouth of Lagos Lagoon. Due to rapid urbanization, the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present day Lagos Mainland. This led to the classification of Lagos into two main areas – the Island, which was the initial city of Lagos, before it expanded into the area known as the Mainland.

      Lagos was originally inhabited by the Awori subgroup of the Yoruba people in the 15th century, who called it “Oko”. In the 16th century, the Awori settlement was conquered by the Benin Empire and the island became a Benin war-camp called “Eko”. Eko is still the native name for Lagos.
